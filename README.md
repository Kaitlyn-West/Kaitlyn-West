Hi, I’m @Kaitlyn-West, my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am a student at the university of Cincinnati studying computer science! I've had an interest in programming for a long time, and have learned C++, Python, C#, and Java, as well as HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, and I've recently starting working with MatLab and LabView VI. I also really enjoy working with @desmosinc's graphing calculator, in fact, I was even one of the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art-2023#17;sahvbml7w7">winner</a>'s for their <a href="https://www.desmos.com/art-2023#17">2023 art contest</a>!
