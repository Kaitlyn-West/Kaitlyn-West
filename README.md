## My Background
  Hi, Iâ€™m [@Kaitlyn-West](https://github.com/Kaitlyn-West), my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am a student at the [University of Cincinnati](https://uc.edu) studying [computer science](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-science-bachelor-of-science.html)! I've had an interest in programming ever since my middle school did an [Hour of Code](https://code.org) event, which led to me participating in my [high school's Tech Prep program](https://centervilleitcs.com)! Aside from my love for programming, I also have a passion for the performing arts. In high school I participated in [marching band](https://youtu.be/PoQOS9aAL9A?si=9SlV_SQMoCg4N9_S) where I [played baritone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtGiZ8_5iSI), and in [winter drumline](https://youtu.be/DwyODt1GPcw?si=U35vGN6Z0Om2F34L), I [played cymbals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDi9bAtpnC8). Both of these activities were integral to shaping who I am today, and I am forever grateful for the opportunities and experiences they provided. 

## Recreational Work
  I also really enjoy working with [@desmosinc](https://github.com/desmosinc)'s graphing calculator, in fact, I was even one of the [winners](https://www.desmos.com/art-2023#17;sahvbml7w7) for their [2023 art contest](https://www.desmos.com/art-2023#17)! I made [two](https://www.desmos.com/3d/sqwdaw1teh) [attempts](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/eqzu1wlhlq) for the [2024 art contest](https://desmos.com/art) as well, but the 19+ age bracket had [some](https://www.desmos.com/art#19;7rjmjitoa2) [exceptional](https://www.desmos.com/art#19;vjolrybqdt) [submissions](https://www.desmos.com/art#19;icoaxvej64) that I simply couldn't compare to yet. Most of my recreational programming work is on [Desmos](https://desmos.com), which presents unique challenges that I enjoy solving. Seeing the brilliant works others create with this tool is incredibly inspiring, and I strive to match the creativity, ingenuity, and dedication.
