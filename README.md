  Hi, Iâ€™m [@Kaitlyn-West](https://github.com/Kaitlyn-West), my pronouns are she/her/hers, and I am a student at the [University of Cincinnati](https://uc.edu) studying [computer science](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-science-bachelor-of-science.html)! I've had an interest in programming ever since my middle school did a [hour of code](https://code.org) event, which led to me participating in my [high school's Tech Prep progam](https://centervilleitcs.com)! Aside from my love for programming I also have a passion for the performing arts, in high school I participated in [marching band](https://youtu.be/PoQOS9aAL9A?si=9SlV_SQMoCg4N9_S) where I [played baritone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtGiZ8_5iSI) and, [winter drumline](https://youtu.be/DwyODt1GPcw?si=U35vGN6Z0Om2F34L) where I [played cymbals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDi9bAtpnC8). Both of these activities were integral to shaping who I am today, and I am forever greatful for the opporunities and experiences they provided. 
  
**Languages & Technologies I've worked with:**  
- C++, Python, C#, Java  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL  
- Recently started: MatLab, LabView VI

I also really enjoy working with [@desmosinc](https://github.com/desmosinc)'s graphing calculator, in fact, I was even one of the [winner](https://www.desmos.com/art-2023#17;sahvbml7w7)'s for their [2023 art contest](https://www.desmos.com/art-2023#17)! I made [two](https://www.desmos.com/3d/sqwdaw1teh) [attempts](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/eqzu1wlhlq) for the [2024 art contest](https://desmos.com/art) as well, but the 19+ age bracket had [some](https://www.desmos.com/art#19;7rjmjitoa2) [exceptional](https://www.desmos.com/art#19;vjolrybqdt) [submissions](https://www.desmos.com/art#19;icoaxvej64) that (as much as I hate to admit it) I had no chance against. Most of my recreational programming work has been done on desmos, which presents unique challenges that I enjoy having to find solutions to!
